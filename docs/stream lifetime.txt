stream lifetime:

stream is constructed

may listen or connect

listen or connect triggers success or error

if success, the stream is given to the user
on error, the user does not have access to the instance

user may call write or close

on close, no more messages may be read or sent, and any
pending send operations are completed before the underlying
socket is closed



before a connection is established, none of the shared-with-outside
variables may be accessed safely from the outside.
